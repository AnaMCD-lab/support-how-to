This article shows you how to configure your Rackspace Email account using
your Thunderbird email client.

1. Open Thunderbird.
2. On the welcome screen, click **Email**.

3. In the Mail Account Setup dialog box, enter the following information: 

    - **Your name**: Enter the name that you want to appear in the From field of messages that you send. 

    - **Email address**: Enter your email address (for example, **yourName@example.com**). 

    - **Password**: Enter the password of the email account. 

4. If Thunderbird is unable to automatically configure your account, the dialog box expands to show new fields.
5. Enter the following values in the **Incoming** column: 

    - **IMAP** 

    - **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com 

    - **Port**: 993 

    - **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter the port number.) 

    - **Authentication**: Autodetect 

6. Enter the following values in the **Outgoing** column: 

    - **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com 

    - **Port**: 465 

    - **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter the port number.) 

    - **Authentication**: Autodetect

7. Click **Re-test**.

The **Authentication** fields should change to **Normal Password**, and the following message should appear in the middle of the screen: 

` 
The following setting were found by probing the given server. 
`

8.  Click **Done**. 

You have configured your mailbox in Thunderbird, and mail should start populating the **Inbox**.
