{{<accordion title="What is the service-level pricing model?" col="in" href="accordion2">}}

The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total
cloud expense by separating infrastructure and support costs.

The infrastructure rate depends on the number of gigabytes (GB) of random
access memory (RAM) used during the billing cycle, not on the server types.
This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers.

The support cost, or Service Level Rate, is determined by the total Compute
power used. The Service Level Rate covers the maintenance and support of all
your cloud Compute products (such as servers) and depends on your service
level. OnMetal servers have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM. If you do
not meet the minimum Service Level Rate during your billing cycle, we assess
the difference to your account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but we assess the Service
Level Rate against only Compute products. Storage services, such as Cloud Files
and Cloud Block Storage, have no Service Level Rates associated with them.

{{<accordion title="Can new customers choose other service levels for Managed OpenStack Public Cloud?" col="in" href="accordion3">}}

No, new customers can choose Managed Infrastructure or Managed
Operations. Customers with an older service level, such as the Infrastructure
service level, can stay on that level or move to one of the new levels.
Customers who upgrade to a new service level can't return to the old level.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?" col="in" href="accordion4">}}

Customers who have the Infrastructure service level keep 
their current pricing plan and continue to receive the same support.
