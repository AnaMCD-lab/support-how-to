This series of articles provides an introduction to NoSQL databases, and
explains the differences between NoSQL databases and relational databases.
You can organize databases of both types so that a database management system
can access and pull specific information from them. The articles touch on
commonly used relational database management systems (RDBMSs), such as Oracle Database&reg;, and popular NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB&reg; and Apache Cassandra&reg;.

These articles are intended to help you identify areas where you can best
leverage an RDBMS or a NoSQL database. Rackspace Application Services (RAS)
supports most currently available databases. Learn more about [Rackspace
